- **Variable**: A variable is a container that holds data. Variables are used to store information that can be used later in the program. Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, and objects.
- **Function**: A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to organize code and make it easier to read and maintain. Functions can take input, called parameters, and return output, called a return value.
- **Object**: An object is a collection of key-value pairs. Objects are used to store data in a structured way. Objects can contain properties and methods, which are used to access and manipulate the data stored in the object.
- **Array**: An array is a collection of elements. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays can contain different types of data, such as numbers, strings, and objects.
- **String**: A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are used to store text data. Strings can contain letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Number**: A number is a numeric value. Numbers are used to store numerical data. Numbers can be integers or floating-point values.
- **Boolean**: A boolean is a logical value that can be either true or false. Booleans are used to store binary data. Booleans are often used in conditional statements to control the flow of a program.
- **Syntax**: Syntax refers to the rules that govern how code is written in a programming language. Syntax errors occur when code is written incorrectly and does not follow the rules of the language.
